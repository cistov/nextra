# Docs Theme

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

This website is built with the docs theme.

The [Get Started](https://github.com/cistov/nextra/tree/2e5bd86b7c2ff2a27c03243453688c6644dd4c4f/get-started/README.md) page is a great place to start.

Just put all your Markdown files \(`.md`, `.mdx`\) under the `pages` directory. It's the best way to organize your documentation:

You can also use a `meta.json` file to config the order and displayed name of the page \([example](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/blob/master/pages/meta.json)\).
