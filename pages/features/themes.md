# Themes

Nextra itself is basically a plugin that normalizes your Markdown routes in Next.js into structural data, and it doesn't handle any styling related thing. A **theme** is what renders your actual pages, it works like a layout component in React.

Nextra has 2 official themes that you can use:

* [Docs Theme](https://github.com/cistov/nextra/tree/2e5bd86b7c2ff2a27c03243453688c6644dd4c4f/themes/docs/README.md)
* [Blog Theme](https://github.com/cistov/nextra/tree/2e5bd86b7c2ff2a27c03243453688c6644dd4c4f/themes/blog/README.md)

You can also extend your own themes. Here's a great starter example by [@jaredpalmer](https://github.com/jaredpalmer):
